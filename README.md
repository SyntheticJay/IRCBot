# IRCBot
A dynamic, flexible IRC bot with customisable names and command features.

## How do I use?

Simple, just import the project using your favourite IDE and get coding!
Programming it is just easy, I've included a couple of examples for you to follow along to, it's reletively easy anyway...

## Usage

To be able to use my IRCBot base, you must include credits where credit is due, along with that, you MUST leave the file headers intact
as they are my other source of credits if you decide to open source your code.
